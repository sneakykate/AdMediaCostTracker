== README

This prototype was created using Rails, Postgres, fog, carrierwave, AWS S3, bcrypt, Bootstrap.

We had been using Excel to track media data and were having major inconsistencies internally. So, I took a Rails class in the hopes of creating something with a usable UI and a database. That way, we would have the opportunity to create a 'single source of truth' for our cost data.

This app is deployed at https://shrouded-forest-1681.herokuapp.com/, password upon request (all data is dummy data).
